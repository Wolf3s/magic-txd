=========================================================

This repository is a collaboration of GTAForums community developers to provide
an amazing TXD editor that supports all known texture formats. We aim to create
a very flexible and easy-to-use application.

Its main goal is to support every RenderWare3 TXD file out there. We currently support
Direct3D8, Direct3D9, PS2, XBOX, Gamecube, PSP, mobile (GTA3 Android) native textures.

Magic.TXD compiles for the Windows platform. If there is big enough demand we could
release a Linux build aswell.
